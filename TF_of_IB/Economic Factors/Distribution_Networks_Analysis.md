# Distribution Networks for Renewable Energy: Iceland and Vietnam

## Current State of Distribution Networks

| Country     | Grid Connectivity                          | Infrastructure Quality                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Iceland** | Comprehensive national grid managed by Landsnet. | Robust infrastructure; challenges in connecting isolated areas. |
| **Vietnam** | Extensive grid with nearly universal access. | Strained by rapid renewable energy expansion, leading to grid congestion and curtailment. |
