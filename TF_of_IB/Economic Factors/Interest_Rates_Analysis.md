## Impact on Renewable Energy Financing

### Iceland:
- **High Interest Rate (9.00%):** Increases the cost of borrowing for renewable energy projects.
- Financing for capital-intensive projects like geothermal expansion or hydrogen production may face challenges.
- Strong government policies and a well-established renewable energy framework could offset high borrowing costs to some extent.

### Vietnam:
- **Low Interest Rate (4.50%):** Encourages investment in renewable energy projects such as solar and wind.
- Aligns with ambitious government targets for renewable energy penetration (39.2% by 2030, 71.5% by 2050).
- Challenges remain, including regulatory hurdles and grid integration, which may limit the pace of development.

## Summary:
- **Iceland:** High interest rates challenge renewable energy financing but are balanced by government support and a robust renewable energy sector.
- **Vietnam:** Low interest rates provide a favorable environment for renewable energy investments, aligning with government goals, though other systemic challenges persist.
