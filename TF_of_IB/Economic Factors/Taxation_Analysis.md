## Impact of Taxation on Renewable Energy Growth

### Iceland:
- **Policy Context:** No targeted tax incentives due to established 100% renewable energy infrastructure.
- **Corporate Investment:** Competitive corporate tax rate supports general business operations but does not actively promote new renewable projects.
- **Limitations:** Lack of tax-driven incentives may restrict the expansion of innovative renewable projects, such as hydrogen.

### Vietnam:
- **Policy Context:** Targeted incentives, such as a preferential 10% corporate tax rate, directly support renewable energy investments.
- **Corporate Investment:** Favorable taxation has driven significant growth in solar and wind energy projects.
- **Challenges:** Regulatory and infrastructure barriers may offset the benefits of tax incentives.

## Summary:
- **Iceland:** While tax policies are neutral, the country's established renewable energy infrastructure reduces the need for incentives. This may limit the push for innovation in new renewable energy projects.
- **Vietnam:** Tax incentives play a critical role in driving renewable energy growth, fostering investment in solar and wind projects despite external challenges.
