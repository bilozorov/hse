| **12. Antitrust Laws**                           | **Iceland**                                                                                     | **Vietnam**                                                                                      |
| **Regulatory Framework**                    | The Icelandic Competition Authority (ICA) enforces the Competition Act, which prohibits anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominant positions, and mergers that may significantly impede competition. ([globalcompetitionreview.com](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/insight/enforcer-hub/2023/organization-profile/icelandic-competition-authority)) | The Vietnam Competition Commission (VCC), established on April 1, 2023, oversees the Competition Law 2018, addressing anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominance, and economic concentrations that may substantially lessen competition.

| **Market Concentration Ratios**             | Specific data on market concentration ratios in Iceland's renewable energy sector is limited. The sector is characterized by a few dominant players, including state-owned enterprises, which may influence competition dynamics. | Detailed statistics on market concentration ratios in Vietnam's renewable energy sector are not publicly available. The market is expanding with increasing participation from both domestic and foreign investors, leading to a more competitive environment. |
| **Number of Antitrust Cases in the Energy Sector** | The ICA has investigated cases in the energy sector, focusing on potential anti-competitive practices. However, specific figures on the number of cases in the renewable energy sub-sector are not readily accessible. ([globalcompetitionreview.com](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/insight/enforcer-hub/2023/organization-profile/icelandic-competition-authority)) | The VCC, being newly established, has yet to disclose specific data on antitrust cases in the renewable energy sector. Historically, the Vietnam Competition and Consumer Authority (VCCA) handled such cases, but detailed statistics are limited.

| **Fines Imposed for Anti-Competitive Behavior** | In September 2023, the ICA fined transport and logistics company Samskip €29 million for collusion, marking a significant enforcement action. ([globalcompetitionreview.com](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/article/iceland-fines-samskip-following-decade-long-investigation)) While this case is outside the renewable energy sector, it demonstrates the ICA's commitment to addressing anti-competitive behavior. | Specific data on fines imposed for anti-competitive behavior in Vietnam's renewable energy sector is not publicly available. The VCC is expected to enhance enforcement activities, potentially leading to more transparency in the future.

| **Impact on Competition in Renewable Energy Markets** | The ICA's enforcement of antitrust laws aims to prevent anti-competitive practices, promoting a fair and competitive renewable energy market. However, the dominance of state-owned enterprises may pose challenges to market entry for new players. | The establishment of the VCC signifies a strengthening of antitrust enforcement, which is expected to foster a more competitive renewable energy market. Ongoing reforms and increased transparency are anticipated to encourage fair competition and attract investment. |
