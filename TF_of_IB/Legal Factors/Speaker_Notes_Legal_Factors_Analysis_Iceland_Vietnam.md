### **Changes in Legislation (“Grandfather's Clause”)**
- **Iceland:** Updated Electricity Act (2021); no explicit grandfathering, but existing projects continue under original licenses.
- **Vietnam:** Revised Environmental Law (2022); existing projects allowed transition periods for compliance.
- **Impact:** Iceland focuses on modernization; Vietnam balances reforms with transitional provisions.
- **Comparison:** Iceland’s updates to its legal framework modernize its energy sector but lack explicit grandfathering clauses. Vietnam, on the other hand, balances reforms with transitional provisions, aiding project compliance.

### **Antitrust Laws**

## **Iceland**
- **Summary:** Iceland’s renewable energy sector is heavily regulated and dominated by state-owned enterprises, which limits competitive opportunities for private and foreign investors. The country’s alignment with European Union (EU) standards ensures high safety, environmental, and consumer protection standards. However, Iceland does not offer specific incentives for foreign investments in renewable energy, and the lack of explicit grandfathering provisions in new legislation means that foreign companies need to stay agile to adapt to regulatory changes.
- **Best Strategy:** **Joint Ventures**  
   - **Rationale:** A Joint Venture (JV) provides the ideal balance between local integration and operational control. Given Iceland’s focus on state-owned enterprises, forming a JV with an established Icelandic entity, such as a state-owned company or a local private firm, can help navigate regulatory requirements, leverage local expertise, and build credibility. This strategy allows foreign companies to operate within Iceland’s structured and stable regulatory environment while mitigating high entry costs associated with wholly owned operations.

## **Vietnam**
- **Summary:** Vietnam has a more open approach to foreign investment in the renewable energy sector, providing attractive incentives such as full foreign ownership, tax breaks, and subsidies. Vietnam’s regulatory environment is evolving rapidly, with new laws like the National Power Development Plan VIII and environmental protection updates that include transitional provisions for existing projects. While Vietnam’s market is growing and more competitive, challenges remain due to bureaucratic complexities, potential delays in approval processes, and enforcement limitations.
- **Best Strategy:** **Greenfield Operations (Subsidiaries)**  
   - **Rationale:** Given Vietnam’s openness to foreign investment, setting up a wholly owned subsidiary through a Greenfield Operation is a suitable choice. This strategy allows foreign companies to capitalize on Vietnam’s incentives for renewable energy projects while maintaining full control over operations, compliance, and environmental standards. Establishing a subsidiary enables companies to directly manage regulatory compliance and navigate Vietnam’s specific labeling and safety requirements without relying on local partners, making it ideal for firms seeking long-term growth in Vietnam’s expanding market.

## Summary Table

| **Country** | **Recommended Strategy** | **Rationale** |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Iceland** | Joint Ventures | Balances local integration with control, allowing foreign firms to leverage local expertise and meet regulatory standards without bearing full entry costs. |
| **Vietnam** | Greenfield Operations (Subsidiaries) | Enables full ownership and control, taking advantage of Vietnam’s investment incentives and supporting compliance with the evolving regulatory environment. |
