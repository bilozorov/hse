# Trade Restrictions - Key Points

- **Import Duties**: Select renewable equipment qualifies for exemptions, but tariffs still apply to some, raising project costs.
- **Partnerships**: No explicit restrictions, though strategic investments may face scrutiny.
- **Cross-Border**: EVN's control and lack of regulatory framework limit cross-border energy trade.
