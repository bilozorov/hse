# Vietnam's Foreign Policy and its Impact on the Renewable Energy Sector

Vietnam's foreign policy towards major energy trade partners—China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States—significantly influences its renewable energy sector. Diplomatic relations and partnerships with these nations shape investment opportunities and facilitate energy technology transfers.

## China

Vietnam maintains a complex relationship with China, balancing cooperation and competition. Both countries have engaged in joint development agreements in the South China Sea, focusing on energy security and sovereignty. However, territorial disputes present challenges to deeper collaboration in renewable energy projects.
