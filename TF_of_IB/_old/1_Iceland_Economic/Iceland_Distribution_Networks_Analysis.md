# Distribution Networks: Iceland's Renewable Energy Sector

## Overview of Iceland's Distribution Networks

Iceland’s renewable energy is primarily transmitted through a well-developed national grid that connects geothermal and hydropower plants to consumers across the country. The country’s isolated location and small population have driven the creation of an efficient distribution network, but challenges remain as Iceland seeks to expand its renewable energy capacity and explore export options.

### Key Infrastructure and Transmission System

The national grid is operated by **Landsnet**, a publicly owned company responsible for the transmission and distribution of electricity across Iceland. The grid covers the entire country, with high-voltage lines extending from key energy-producing regions to the capital and industrial hubs. Approximately **90%** of Iceland’s electricity comes from renewable sources, primarily hydropower and geothermal energy, and the existing infrastructure is well-equipped to handle current demand.

- **Grid Size**: The transmission network consists of **3,000 km** of high-voltage transmission lines, with substations and power lines connecting urban areas and industrial consumers, including energy-intensive industries like aluminum smelting.
- **Grid Stability**: Due to its isolation, Iceland has developed a robust and stable grid, with **99.99% reliability**, ensuring consistent energy delivery to homes and industries.

### Support for Renewable Energy Growth

While the current distribution network is highly reliable, Iceland is focusing on expanding its infrastructure to accommodate increased renewable energy generation. Landsnet has developed a **10-year investment plan** aimed at enhancing transmission capacity to support the growing demand for green energy, especially in industrial projects and potential energy exports.

1. **New Transmission Lines**: The grid is being upgraded with new high-capacity transmission lines to facilitate the integration of more renewable energy from emerging sources like **wind** and **green hydrogen** production facilities.
   
2. **Renewable Energy Export Potential**: Iceland is exploring opportunities to export electricity via **submarine power cables** to Europe. This would require significant upgrades to the transmission network and the development of new interconnectors to meet European energy demands.

### Potential Bottlenecks

Although the distribution network is efficient, several potential bottlenecks could impact future growth:
- **Rural Areas**: Some remote regions of Iceland have less developed infrastructure, limiting the capacity to deliver renewable energy to these areas.
- **Export Challenges**: While Iceland is well-positioned to export renewable energy, the lack of existing transmission links to other countries presents a significant bottleneck. Building the necessary submarine power cables to Europe would require substantial investment and cross-border agreements.
