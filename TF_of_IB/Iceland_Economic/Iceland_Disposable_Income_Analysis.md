# Disposable Income of Consumers: Iceland's Renewable Energy Sector

## Disposable Income and Consumer Behavior in Iceland

In 2023, the average disposable income per capita in Iceland stood at approximately **ISK 6.5 million** annually, according to the Icelandic National Statistics Institute. However, rising inflation and increased living costs have eroded purchasing power, impacting consumer spending habits. Despite this, Icelandic consumers remain highly supportive of renewable energy and sustainability efforts due to strong environmental awareness.

### Impact on Demand for Renewable Energy Products and Services

1. **Energy Pricing and Consumption Patterns**:
   Despite high inflation, energy prices in Iceland remain relatively affordable for consumers due to the extensive use of domestic renewable energy sources, such as geothermal and hydropower. The average household electricity cost in Iceland is **ISK 12.7 per kWh**, which is lower than in many European countries. As a result, high disposable income levels coupled with low energy prices lead to steady electricity consumption among Icelandic households.

2. **Willingness to Adopt Sustainable Energy Solutions**:
   Icelandic consumers are generally willing to adopt sustainable energy products and services. Studies show that more than **70%** of households are open to using energy-efficient technologies like **electric heat pumps** and **solar panels**. High disposable income and strong environmental consciousness contribute to this trend, even amid economic challenges.

3. **Green Energy Products**:
   The willingness to pay for green energy products, such as electric vehicles (EVs), is also high. EV adoption in Iceland has been growing rapidly, with **14.8%** of new car sales in 2022 being electric. Consumers are motivated not only by environmental factors but also by government incentives that make these technologies more affordable.

### Government Initiatives and Consumer Support

The Icelandic government offers various subsidies and tax breaks to encourage the adoption of renewable energy technologies, further bolstering consumer interest. These measures are particularly important as inflation and other economic pressures could otherwise reduce disposable income available for such investments.
