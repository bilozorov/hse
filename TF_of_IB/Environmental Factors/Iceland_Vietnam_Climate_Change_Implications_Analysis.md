| **Factor**                 | **Iceland**                                                                                                                                           | **Vietnam**                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sea-Level Rise**         | Local sea levels may decrease due to gravitational changes from Greenland's ice melt.                                                                 | Over 70% of land in some Mekong Delta provinces at risk of inundation within 80 years.                                                             |
| **Flooding**               | Minimal risk of large-scale flooding; glacial melt contributes slightly to global sea-level rise.                                                     | High exposure to riverine, flash, and coastal flooding, threatening infrastructure and agriculture.                                                 |
| **Glacial Melt**           | Loses ~10 billion tons of ice annually; land uplift of up to 3.8 cm/year. Impacts hydropower sustainability.                                           | Not applicable.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Extreme Weather Events** | Limited exposure to extreme weather events.                                                                                                          | High risk from tropical cyclones and associated hazards, disrupting energy infrastructure and supply chains.                                        |
| **Renewable Energy Impact**| Hydropower may initially benefit from increased water flow due to glacial melt but face long-term challenges. Geothermal energy may see altered dynamics.| Flooding and extreme weather damage hydropower facilities, solar panels, and wind turbines, disrupting generation and efficiency.                   |
