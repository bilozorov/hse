| **Lithium**                | No significant domestic reserves; 100% import dependency for lithium required in battery storage systems.                                                   | No notable lithium reserves; reliant on imports for lithium-dependent technologies.                                                                       |
| **Rare Earth Elements (REEs)** | No significant domestic reserves; fully reliant on imports for REE needs.                                                                                 | Substantial reserves (~22 million metric tons), accounting for ~19% of global reserves. Production increased from 400 metric tons (2021) to 4,300 metric tons (2022). |

## Summary

- **Iceland**:
  - Challenges: Complete reliance on imports for lithium and REEs, making it vulnerable to global market fluctuations.
  - Strengths: High integration of renewable energy systems minimizes dependence on material-heavy technologies.

- **Vietnam**:
  - Strengths: Significant REE reserves provide a strategic advantage, with potential for expansion in global supply chains.
  - Challenges: Requires technological and infrastructural improvements to fully exploit REE reserves; also dependent on imported lithium.
