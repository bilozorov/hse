| **Renewable Energy Generation Capacity** | ~2,935 MW (2020): Hydropower (2,107 MW, 71.8%), Geothermal (755 MW, 25.7%), Wind (1.8 MW, 0.06%); electricity production ~19,127 GWh (99.98% from renewables). | ~76,620 MW (2023): Hydropower (25,322 MW, 33%), Solar (16,500 MW, 21.5%), Wind (4,800 MW, 6.3%); electricity production ~247,000 GWh (14% from renewables, 2020).    |
| **Electricity Prices**      | Households: ~$0.14/kWh; Industries: ~$0.05/kWh. Among the lowest in Europe due to abundant renewables.                                                               | Households: ~$0.08/kWh; Industries: ~$0.07/kWh. Among the lowest in Southeast Asia, supported by subsidies and diverse energy mix.                                    |
| **Energy Self-Sufficiency** | Nearly 100% self-sufficient; 85% of total primary energy supply derived from domestically produced renewable sources.                                                 | Approximately 50% self-sufficient; reliant on imported coal and oil for energy demands.                                                                              |
