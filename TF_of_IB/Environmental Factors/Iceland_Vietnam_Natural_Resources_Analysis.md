| **Geothermal Potential**    | Installed capacity: ~799 MW; over 20 TWh/year untapped potential.                                                                                                           | Geothermal development is currently minimal with no significant contribution to the energy mix.                                                                              |
| **Solar Potential**         | Average solar insolation: ~2.6 kWh/m²/day; limited potential for large-scale solar projects.                                                                                 | Average solar insolation: 3.69–5.9 kWh/m²/day (north to south); 1,500–2,600 sunshine hours annually. Installed solar capacity: ~19,400 MWp (25% of total energy capacity).  |
| **Wind Potential**          | Coastal areas average wind speeds: 6–7 m/s; suitable for small-scale wind energy projects.                                                                                  | Onshore wind potential: 24 GW (wind speeds >6 m/s); additional 404 GW potential at wind speeds of 5–6 m/s. Targets: 18 GW by 2030, 96.7 GW (42.7 GW onshore, 54 GW offshore) by 2045. |
