## Summary

- **Iceland**:
  - Strengths: Strong winds and moderate sunlight exposure favor wind energy development.
  - Challenges: Limited hours of sunlight may restrict large-scale solar energy projects.

- **Vietnam**:
  - Strengths: Warmer climate and higher sunlight exposure support solar energy development; coastal winds enhance wind energy potential.
  - Challenges: Variable wind speeds across regions require targeted site selection for wind energy projects.
