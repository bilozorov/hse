# Environmental Legislation Analysis for Renewable Energy Development

| **Factor**                 | **Iceland**                                                                                                                                       | **Vietnam**                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subsidies and Incentives** | Tax exemptions and subsidies for renewable energy projects focusing on innovation and sustainability.                                           | Offers tax exemptions, land-use fee reductions, and favorable loan conditions; attracts foreign investment in the renewable energy sector.         |
| **Feed-in Tariffs (FiTs)**  | No specific FiT system; energy market relies on bilateral agreements with market-driven pricing.                                                | Previous FiTs: $0.085/kWh (onshore wind) and $0.098/kWh (offshore wind). Transitioning to competitive bidding mechanisms as of 2024.              |
| **Environmental Permits**  | Stringent permitting process overseen by the National Energy Authority to ensure compliance with environmental standards.                       | Streamlined permitting process with new regulations to expedite project approvals and reduce bureaucratic delays.                                   |
