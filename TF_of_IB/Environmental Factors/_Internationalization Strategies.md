# Best Internationalization Strategies for Renewable Energy in Vietnam and Iceland

## Vietnam: Joint Ventures (Strategic Alliances with Equity Investment)

### Key Environmental Factors:
- **Abundant Renewable Resources:** Vietnam possesses significant potential in solar and wind energy, with average solar insolation ranging from 3.69 to 5.9 kWh/m²/day and onshore wind potential estimated at 24 GW.
- **Rapidly Growing Energy Demand:** With a population exceeding 96 million and ongoing industrialization, Vietnam's energy consumption is escalating, necessitating swift development of renewable energy infrastructure.
- **Regulatory and Geopolitical Challenges:** The country faces complex regulatory environments and geopolitical issues, such as disputes in the South China Sea, which can impact energy projects.

### Rationale:
- Forming joint ventures with local partners enables foreign renewable energy companies to effectively navigate Vietnam's regulatory landscape and leverage local expertise.
- Collaborating with established Vietnamese firms facilitates access to essential resources, ensures compliance with local regulations, and enhances community acceptance.
- This strategy also allows for shared financial risks and capital investments, making large-scale renewable energy projects more feasible.

## Reasons Why Other Internationalization Strategies Are Not Ideal for Vietnam

### 1. Exporting (Direct or Indirect):
- **High Transportation Costs:** Renewable energy components (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines) are bulky and expensive to ship.
- **Limited Local Engagement:** Exporting does not allow for the necessary local partnerships and community buy-in critical for energy projects.
- **Regulatory Barriers:** Vietnam has specific import restrictions and tariffs that make exporting less viable for large-scale renewable projects.

### 2. Licensing or Franchising:
- **Loss of Control:** Licensing local firms could lead to diluted quality and standards in project implementation.
- **Limited Influence on Policy:** The renewable energy market in Vietnam requires direct engagement with government stakeholders, which is challenging through licensing.
- **Profit Margins:** Licensing typically generates lower profit margins compared to equity-based strategies.

### 3. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):
- **High Financial Risk:** Acquiring existing companies in a rapidly evolving sector like renewable energy can be financially risky due to fluctuating market conditions.
- **Integration Challenges:** Cultural and operational integration with a Vietnamese firm may be complex and time-consuming.
- **Limited Scope for Customization:** Acquisitions may lock the company into legacy infrastructure and limit the adoption of innovative technologies.

### 4. Greenfield Operations:
- **High Initial Investment:** Building a renewable energy project from scratch in Vietnam requires substantial capital.
- **Long Time to Market:** Greenfield operations in Vietnam might face delays due to regulatory approvals and land acquisition challenges.
- **Local Expertise Gap:** Without partnerships, understanding local market dynamics may be difficult.

## Iceland: Greenfield Operations - Subsidiaries (Investment Strategies)

### Key Environmental Factors:
- **Vast Geothermal Resources:** Iceland has an installed geothermal capacity of approximately 799 MW, with over 20 TWh/year of untapped potential, making it a leader in geothermal energy.
- **Limited Solar and Wind Potential:** Due to its geographical location, Iceland has limited potential for large-scale solar and wind energy projects.
- **High Labor Costs:** Iceland's high standard of living results in elevated labor costs for renewable energy projects.

### Rationale:
- Establishing wholly owned subsidiaries allows companies to fully control technology deployment and ensure that proprietary renewable technologies are implemented effectively.
- In Iceland, this approach is advantageous due to the country's specific focus on geothermal energy, where specialized expertise is crucial.
- Operating through a local subsidiary can enhance compliance with local regulations and benefit from government incentives for renewable energy projects.
- Additionally, full ownership enables the company to retain all profits and make strategic decisions without external influence, maximizing long-term return on investment.

## Reasons Why Other Internationalization Strategies Are Not Ideal for Iceland

### 1. Exporting (Direct or Indirect):
- **Market Size Limitation:** Iceland’s small population (~370,000) limits the scale of operations, making exporting less effective.
- **Infrastructure Requirements:** Exporting renewable energy, such as electricity, requires extensive grid infrastructure that may not exist.
- **Climate-Specific Technologies:** Exporting standard renewable energy products (like solar panels) is unsuitable for Iceland’s unique geothermal-dominant energy landscape.

### 2. Licensing or Franchising:
- **Lack of Expertise Retention:** Licensing out geothermal technologies to local firms might lead to suboptimal project outcomes due to a lack of specialized expertise.
- **Control and Innovation Loss:** Geothermal energy projects require cutting-edge technology and expertise, which may not be adequately maintained through licensing agreements.

### 3. Joint Ventures:
- **Limited Need for Partnerships:** Iceland's renewable energy sector is already well-developed, and joint ventures may not add significant value.
- **Profit-Sharing:** Joint ventures require sharing profits and decision-making power, which can reduce returns and strategic flexibility in such a niche market.
- **Lack of Scalability:** Iceland’s small market size limits the benefits of joint ventures compared to full ownership.

### 4. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):
- **High Market Entry Costs:** Acquiring local geothermal energy companies can be prohibitively expensive due to Iceland’s established market.
- **Integration Risks:** Cultural and operational integration may not yield significant advantages in such a highly specialized sector.
- **Limited Opportunities:** Iceland’s market is small, and there are fewer firms to acquire, making it less attractive for M&A strategies.

## Conclusion
Each strategy has limitations based on the unique environmental and market factors of Vietnam and Iceland:
- In **Vietnam**, the need for local partnerships and regulatory navigation makes joint ventures the optimal choice over other strategies.
- In **Iceland**, the importance of control and technological expertise favors greenfield operations, whereas other strategies fall short in addressing the country's niche geothermal energy focus.
