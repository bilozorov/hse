|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Greenfield Investment**  | Establishing wholly-owned operations from scratch, such as building new facilities or power plants. | - Politically stable and transparent, with strong legal protections.<br> - Tax breaks, R&D grants, and incentives.<br> - Minimal restrictions on ownership.     | - High initial costs and financial risk.<br> - Small market size.                                           | - Access to growing energy demand and large population.<br> - Economic zones may offer incentives.                         | - Regulatory hurdles and corruption risks.<br> - Foreign ownership restrictions and bureaucratic inefficiencies.           |
| **Joint Venture (JV)**     | Partnering with a local company to create a jointly owned entity.        | - Reduces initial investment risk.<br> - Access to local expertise and market insights.<br> - Qualifies for government incentives.                               | - Less necessity due to already transparent investment environment.<br> - Potential management conflicts.     | - Helps navigate regulatory complexities.<br> - Partial access to restricted sectors.<br> - Local partner insights.     | - Potential for conflicts with local partner.<br> - Limited control and operational inefficiencies due to corruption.     |
| **Licensing or Franchising** | Allowing a local firm to use the company’s technology or brand in exchange for fees or royalties. | - Minimal investment risk.<br> - Strong IP protections.<br> - Quick market entry without physical presence.                 | - Limited revenue potential.<br> - Reduced control over quality standards.                                  | - Low-risk entry without ownership issues.<br> - Avoids bureaucratic hurdles.                                          | - Weak IP protection.<br> - Challenges enforcing licensing agreements in a less transparent legal environment.            |
| **Exporting Equipment and Technology** | Exporting renewable energy equipment or technology without a physical presence in the market. | - Low tariffs on renewable tech due to EFTA agreements.<br> - No need for a physical presence, reducing investment risk. | - Limited market impact and control.<br> - Potentially smaller market influence.                            | - Access to market with minimal risk.<br> - ASEAN trade agreements ease some imports.                                     | - Higher tariffs on some imports.<br> - Limited brand presence and influence in Vietnam’s energy sector.                   |

## Recommended Strategies

### For Iceland: **Greenfield Investment (Full Ownership)**
- **Why**: Iceland's stable and transparent political environment, strong government incentives, and minimal foreign ownership restrictions make greenfield investment an attractive choice for establishing wholly-owned facilities.
- **Motivation**: Full ownership enables complete operational control and allows the company to fully leverage Iceland’s renewable energy policies. While initial costs are high, the predictable, low-risk investment environment justifies this approach.

### For Vietnam: **Joint Venture (JV) with a Local Partner**
- **Why**: Vietnam’s complex regulatory environment, higher corruption levels, and foreign ownership restrictions make a joint venture with a local partner the best option.
- **Motivation**: A JV offers partial access to the restricted energy sector while leveraging local expertise to navigate regulatory hurdles, minimizing operational risks while establishing a presence in the growing Vietnamese energy market.
