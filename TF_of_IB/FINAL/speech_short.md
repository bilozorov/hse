# Presentation Script (Condensed and Fact-Focused)

**Context:**  
We conducted a PESTEL analysis on Vietnam and Iceland’s renewable energy sectors. Our goal: Identify the best internationalization strategies for each market.

### Person 2 (Political, Economic, Social)

**Political Factors:**  
- **Vietnam:** Frequent policy changes; complex approvals (PDP7, PDP8 revisions).  
- **Iceland:** Stable legislation, ~50+ years of consistent renewable energy laws.

**Economic Factors:**  
- **Vietnam:** Rapid demand growth (8-10%/year), large market (~98M people), rising solar capacity (>16 GW solar by 2021). Financing often 6-8% USD loans.  
- **Iceland:** Small market (~370k population), low interest rates (~3-4%), 100% renewables in electricity, stable economy with Aaa credit rating.

**Social Factors:**  
- **Vietnam:** 70%+ urban respondents concerned about pollution; increasing awareness of solar/wind but cost-sensitive.  
- **Iceland:** >90% public support for renewables; sustainability is cultural norm, high environmental literacy.

**Transition:** These conditions shape risk tolerance, market engagement strategies, and consumer messaging.

### Person 3 (Technological, Environmental, Legal)

**Technological Factors:**  
- **Vietnam:** Rapid solar growth (>0 to 16 GW in ~5 years), but limited R&D and grid integration challenges.  
- **Iceland:** Advanced geothermal/hydro R&D for decades, strong innovation ecosystem, top 15 in global IP protection.

**Environmental Factors:**  
- **Vietnam:** Abundant solar/wind, needs grid upgrades; vulnerability to climate change in coastal areas. Potential offshore wind >200 GW.  
- **Iceland:** Fully tapped renewables (100% electricity), pristine environment, focus on optimization and emerging tech (storage, hydrogen).

**Legal Factors:**  
- **Vietnam:** Evolving regulatory environment, multiple FIT changes, 12-18 months average project approval time.  
- **Iceland:** Stable laws, streamlined permitting (<6 months), strong IP enforcement.

**Transition:** Vietnam requires flexibility; Iceland supports stable, innovation-focused investments.

### Person 4 (Vietnam Strategy: Joint Ventures)

**Vietnam PESTEL Integration:**  
- High growth, complex policies, rising but price-sensitive demand.

**Chosen Strategy: Joint Ventures**  
- Access local networks to navigate regulatory shifts and complex licensing.  
- Joint ventures can address financing challenges, adapt quickly, and build trust with cost-sensitive consumers.

**Key Factors:**  
- Political/legal volatility → local partner reduces risk.  
- Economic scale → rapid scaling via local market knowledge.  
- Social acceptance → partner helps tailor health/affordability messaging.

**Why Not Others?**  
- Wholly owned subsidiary = high risk in unstable environment.  
- Licensing = less control, IP risk.  
- Export = no local adaptation.  
- M&A = high complexity and cost.

### Person 5 (Iceland Strategy: Wholly Owned Subsidiary)

**Iceland PESTEL Integration:**  
- Stable rules, strong IP, mature renewables, highly educated and supportive population.

**Chosen Strategy: Wholly Owned Subsidiary**  
- Full control in a stable, low-risk environment.  
- Strong IP protection encourages introducing proprietary tech.  
- Ideal for R&D-focused solutions (e.g., advanced geothermal, storage).

**Key Factors:**  
- Political/legal stability → long-term planning.  
- Economic predictability + low interest → cost-effective innovation.  
- High social/environmental standards → market ready for premium, advanced solutions.

**Why Not Others?**  
- Joint ventures/licensing dilute control and innovation rewards.  
- Export misses local R&D collaboration.  
- M&A unnecessary in a stable, niche-focused market.

---

**Conclusion:**  
- Vietnam: Joint Ventures to handle complexity and scale.  
- Iceland: Wholly Owned Subsidiary to leverage stability and innovation.
