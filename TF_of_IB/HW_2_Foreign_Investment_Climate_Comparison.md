| **Aspect**                                      | **Iceland**                                                                                                  | **Vietnam**                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Treatment of Foreign Investors**              | Equal treatment to local investors, supported by EEA agreements, ensuring market access and regulatory alignment with the EU. | Foreign investors face more regulatory hurdles; national investors often have preferential treatment.         |
| **Incentives for Foreign Investment**           | Offers tax breaks, R&D grants, and subsidies specifically for renewable energy projects.                     | Limited incentives for foreign investors, with specific economic zones providing some benefits.               |
| **Protection of Investor Rights**               | Strong legal protections, including protection from unfavorable legislative changes (Grandfather clause).    | Investor protections are less robust, and regulatory changes can impact foreign companies’ operations.        |
| **Ease of Doing Business**                      | High ease of doing business, with clear regulatory guidelines and a transparent licensing process.           | Moderate ease of doing business; bureaucratic inefficiencies and lengthy approval processes are common.       |
| **Foreign Ownership Restrictions**              | Minimal restrictions on foreign ownership in the renewable energy sector.                                     | Restrictions in strategic sectors like energy generation; often requires partnerships with local companies.   |
| **Corruption and Bureaucracy**                  | Low corruption levels (CPI 72), fostering a transparent investment environment.                              | Higher corruption levels (CPI 39), with bureaucratic processes often impacting foreign investments.          |
| **Trade Agreements and Tariffs**                | Low tariffs on renewable energy technologies due to EFTA and ACCTS agreements.                               | Tariffs apply to certain imports; ASEAN agreements reduce some trade barriers for regional investors.        |
| **Regulatory Transparency**                     | High transparency in policies, aligning with international standards for investment protection.               | Less transparency, with frequent regulatory changes creating an unpredictable business environment.           |
| **Investment Stability**                        | Highly stable and predictable investment environment, supported by Iceland’s political stability.            | Moderate stability, with some risks due to potential political changes impacting the energy sector.           |

**Summary**: Iceland provides a transparent, stable, and supportive foreign investment climate, with incentives, strong protections, and minimal restrictions for renewable energy companies. In contrast, Vietnam’s investment climate is more challenging due to regulatory complexities, higher corruption, and limited incentives, especially for non-ASEAN foreign investors.
