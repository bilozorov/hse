| **Trade Restrictions (Quotas)**           | Iceland does not impose quotas on renewable energy equipment imports as part of its EEA commitments, which prohibit import quotas. | Vietnam does not impose import quotas on renewable energy equipment, aligning with its goal to reduce trade barriers. ([trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/energy-resource-guide-vietnam-renewable-energy)) |
| **Sanctions**                             | Iceland aligns with EU sanctions, which may affect trade with specific countries, but these sanctions do not target renewable energy trade. | Vietnam does not impose sanctions that affect renewable energy trade. The government focuses on international cooperation. ([trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/energy-resource-guide-vietnam-renewable-energy)) |
| **Regulatory Barriers**                   | Iceland maintains a transparent regulatory environment and clear guidelines to promote renewable energy projects. | Vietnam has streamlined regulatory processes, offering incentives like FiTs and Direct Power Purchase Agreements (DPPAs).

### Conclusion

Both Iceland and Vietnam have minimal trade restrictions in the renewable energy sector. Iceland's adherence to EEA regulations and Vietnam's commitment to reducing trade barriers create favorable environments for renewable energy trade and investment.
