### Impact on Renewable Energy Investments

- **Iceland:** With a high CPI score of 72, Iceland is perceived as having low levels of public sector corruption. This favorable environment fosters investor confidence, encouraging both domestic and foreign investments in the renewable energy sector. The country's political stability and transparent regulatory framework have been instrumental in its leadership in geothermal and hydroelectric energy projects.

- **Vietnam:** Vietnam's CPI score of 41 indicates moderate levels of perceived corruption. This perception can deter potential investors due to concerns over transparency and governance. The Vietnamese government has initiated anti-corruption campaigns to improve this perception and attract foreign investment. However, these efforts have sometimes led to bureaucratic delays, affecting the timely execution of renewable energy projects. For instance, administrative paralysis resulting from anti-corruption measures has caused Vietnam to forfeit significant foreign aid, impacting infrastructure development, including energy projects ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-forfeits-billions-dollars-foreign-aid-amid-anti-graft-freeze-document-2024-05-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### Conclusion

Corruption levels significantly influence investment decisions in the renewable energy sector. Iceland's low corruption perception creates a conducive environment for investment, while Vietnam's higher corruption perception poses challenges, despite governmental efforts to address the issue. Improving transparency and governance is crucial for Vietnam to attract and retain investments in its renewable energy sector.
