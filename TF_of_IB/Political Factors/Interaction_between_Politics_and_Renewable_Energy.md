| **Energy Policy Framework**               | The Icelandic government has established a comprehensive energy policy emphasizing sustainability and renewable resources. This framework provides clear guidelines for energy development and greenhouse gas emission targets. ([government.is](https://www.government.is/topics/business-and-industry/energy/)) | The Vietnamese government has implemented the Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8), which outlines specific targets for renewable energy capacity and generation.

| **Partnerships with Private Companies**   | State-owned Landsvirkjun collaborates with private enterprises to develop geothermal energy projects, contributing to Iceland's renewable energy capacity. | Private companies like Trung Nam Group have collaborated with the government to develop solar power projects in Ninh Thuan Province. |
| **International Collaboration**           | Iceland collaborates with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on geothermal development in Africa, promoting global renewable energy. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_Iceland)) | Vietnam has partnered with international organizations through initiatives like the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), collaborating with countries such as the United States and Japan.

Conclusion

In both Iceland and Vietnam, the interaction between politics and the renewable energy business is characterized by active government involvement through policy development, regulatory frameworks, and strategic partnerships with private companies. These collaborations have been essential in advancing renewable energy projects and achieving national energy goals.
