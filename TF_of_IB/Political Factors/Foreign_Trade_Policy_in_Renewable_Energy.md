| **Trade Agreements**                      | Iceland benefits from the European Economic Area (EEA) for free movement of goods and services, facilitating trade in renewable energy technologies. Iceland also has Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with countries like China and the UK. ([government.is](https://www.government.is/topics/foreign-affairs/external-trade/free-trade-agreements/)) | Vietnam has signed the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), eliminating tariffs on renewable energy equipment, and participates in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) enhancing trade in renewable sectors.

| **Tariffs**                               | Iceland imposes low or zero tariffs on renewable energy equipment imports due to its trade agreements. This supports the affordability of renewable energy technologies. | Vietnam has reduced or eliminated tariffs on renewable energy equipment imports under various trade agreements, encouraging renewable energy growth. |
| **Impact on Renewable Energy Imports/Exports** | Iceland's trade policies have made renewable energy equipment more affordable and have facilitated the export of geothermal technology and services. | The reduction of tariffs has helped import advanced renewable energy technologies, boosting Vietnam's renewable energy market and creating export opportunities in green technologies. |

Conclusion

Both Iceland and Vietnam have implemented trade policies that support the growth of their renewable energy sectors. Iceland's participation in the EEA and various FTAs has facilitated the import of renewable energy equipment and the export of geothermal technology. Vietnam's trade agreements, such as the EVFTA and RCEP, have reduced tariffs on renewable energy equipment, promoting the development of its renewable energy market.
