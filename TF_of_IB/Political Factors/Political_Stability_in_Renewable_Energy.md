### Impact on Political Stability in Renewable Energy Markets

- **Iceland:** The country's longstanding political stability has been instrumental in the consistent development and implementation of renewable energy projects. However, the recent government coalition collapse introduces uncertainty, which could affect future energy policies and projects.

- **Vietnam:** While Vietnam has made significant strides in attracting foreign investment for renewable energy, political instability and leadership changes have led to delays and reconsiderations of major projects. This instability poses challenges to the country's renewable energy ambitions.
