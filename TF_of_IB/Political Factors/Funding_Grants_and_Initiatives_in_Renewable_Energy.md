World Bank-GCF grants promote energy efficiency in renewable energy projects. ([usaid.gov](https://www.usaid.gov/vietnam/fact-sheets/vietnam-low-emission-energy-program-v-leep-ii)) |

### Conclusion

Both Iceland and Vietnam have established funding grants and initiatives to promote renewable energy development. Iceland participates in EU-funded programs like the LIFE Programme and has its own Climate Fund supporting climate-related projects. Vietnam benefits from international collaborations such as V-LEEP II and support from the World Bank and Green Climate Fund to enhance its renewable energy sector.
