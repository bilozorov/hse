| **State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Renewable Energy** | Landsvirkjun, the National Power Company of Iceland, leads renewable energy production with a focus on hydroelectric and geothermal power. It has international operations in the U.S. and the U.K. HS Orka, a geothermal company with state ownership, collaborates with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) on geothermal development in Africa. ([e360.yale.edu](https://e360.yale.edu/features/iceland_seeks_to_cash_in_on_its_abundant_renewable_energy)) | Vietnam Electricity (EVN), a major SOE in Vietnam, is involved in renewable energy projects such as wind and solar power. Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PVN) plays a key role in both the oil and gas and renewable energy sectors.
