# Optimal Internationalization Strategies for Renewable Energy Sector in Iceland and Vietnam

## Iceland: Greenfield Operations – Subsidiaries

### Technological Factors Influencing the Choice:

1. **Advanced Automation in Renewable Energy Projects:** 
   - Iceland's renewable energy sector, particularly in geothermal and hydropower plants, employs advanced automation systems for monitoring and control, enhancing efficiency and reliability.

2. **High Global Innovation Index (GII) Ranking:** 
   - Iceland is ranked 20th globally in the GII, indicating a robust innovation ecosystem that positively impacts its renewable energy sector.

### Rationale:

- Establishing a wholly owned subsidiary in Iceland allows the company to fully integrate and leverage the country's advanced technological infrastructure and innovative environment. 
- This approach ensures complete control over technology deployment, aligning with Iceland's high standards in automation and innovation. 
- Additionally, operating through a local subsidiary can enhance compliance with local regulations and benefit from government incentives for renewable energy projects.

### Why Other Strategies Are Less Suitable:

1. **Joint Ventures:** 
   - Joint ventures could dilute control over advanced technology implementation, risking non-compliance with Iceland's stringent technical standards.
   - Iceland’s small population and limited market size may not justify shared financial risk for high-tech investments.

2. **Exporting:** 
   - Exporting renewable energy technology to Iceland is impractical due to the local focus on self-sustaining energy systems and the need for on-site customization.

3. **Franchising/Licensing:** 
   - Licensing renewable energy technology to Icelandic companies might not be effective due to the country's preference for bespoke, high-quality technical solutions.

4. **R&D Cooperation and Technology Swaps:** 
   - Iceland’s established expertise in renewable energy, particularly geothermal, reduces the need for external technology exchanges.
   - R&D partnerships might lead to intellectual property challenges, and the company could lose competitive advantages by sharing proprietary technology.

## Vietnam: Joint Ventures (Strategic Alliances with Equity Investment)

### Technological Factors Influencing the Choice:

1. **Rapid Adoption of Advanced Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Technologies:** 
   - Vietnam has rapidly adopted advanced solar PV technologies, with solar capacity increasing from 86 MW in 2018 to approximately 4.5 GW by mid-2019.

2. **Progressive Integration of Automation in Renewable Energy Projects:** 
   - Vietnam is progressively integrating automation in its renewable energy projects, especially in large-scale solar farms, to optimize performance and maintenance.

### Rationale:

- Forming a joint venture with a local partner in Vietnam enables the company to navigate the rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. 
- Collaborating with a local entity provides access to established networks and facilitates the integration of advanced technologies tailored to the Vietnamese market. 
- This partnership approach allows for shared financial risks and capital investments, making large-scale renewable energy projects more feasible. 
- Additionally, it promotes cultural integration and builds trust within the community, enhancing the company's reputation and facilitating smoother operations.

### Why Other Strategies Are Less Suitable:

1. **Greenfield Operations:** 
   - Establishing a wholly owned subsidiary in Vietnam may require significant initial investment and risk in a market still evolving in terms of regulatory frameworks for foreign direct investment (FDI) in renewables.

2. **Exporting:** 
   - Exporting renewable energy technologies is limited by Vietnam's focus on developing localized infrastructure and expertise.

3. **Franchising/Licensing:** 
   - Licensing technology to Vietnamese companies might lead to inconsistent quality and implementation, undermining the brand’s reputation in a rapidly growing market.

4. **R&D Cooperation and Technology Swaps:** 
   - Vietnam's focus on infrastructure deployment over R&D means there may be limited mutual benefits from technology swaps.
   - Intellectual property risks are significant in markets with evolving legal frameworks for IP protection.
