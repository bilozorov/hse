# Use of Outsourcing in Renewable Energy R&D in Iceland and Vietnam

| **Factor** | **Iceland** | **Vietnam** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Percentage of R&D Outsourced** | Iceland's renewable energy R&D is primarily conducted domestically, with limited outsourcing. | Vietnam increasingly engages in international collaborations, with a growing percentage of renewable energy R&D activities involving foreign partnerships. |
| **Examples of International Collaborations** | Iceland collaborates with entities like the European Union on geothermal projects, such as the GEORG Geothermal Research Group. | Vietnam partners with countries like Denmark and Germany to develop wind and solar energy projects, exemplified by the Danish Energy Partnership Programme. |
| **Key Sectors Being Outsourced** | Iceland focuses on in-house R&D in geothermal and hydropower sectors, leveraging local expertise. | Vietnam outsources R&D in solar photovoltaic and wind energy technologies to integrate advanced solutions and accelerate sector growth. |

## Concise Analysis:

- **Percentage of R&D Outsourced:** Iceland's reliance on domestic expertise in geothermal and hydropower results in minimal outsourcing. In contrast, Vietnam's strategy to rapidly expand its renewable energy capacity leads to increased international collaborations, effectively outsourcing certain R&D functions.

- **Examples of International Collaborations:** Iceland's participation in EU-funded geothermal research enhances its technological capabilities. Vietnam's partnerships with Denmark and Germany facilitate technology transfer and capacity building in wind and solar energy sectors.

- **Key Sectors Being Outsourced:** Iceland's self-reliance in geothermal and hydropower R&D reflects its established expertise. Vietnam's outsourcing in solar and wind energy R&D allows access to advanced technologies and supports its ambitious renewable energy targets.
