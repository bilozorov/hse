### SPEAKER 1: TECHNOLOGICAL INCENTIVES AND INNOVATION

**Speech:**

"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Let me begin by discussing the **TECHNOLOGY INCENTIVES** driving the renewable energy sectors in Iceland and Vietnam. Iceland provides significant support for renewable energy through subsidies for geothermal and hydropower projects, amounting to approximately 10% of total project costs. Meanwhile, Vietnam has implemented feed-in tariffs for solar and wind energy, offering rates of 8.38 cents per kWh for solar and 9.8 cents per kWh for wind. These policies have been instrumental in encouraging private investment and accelerating renewable energy deployment in both countries.

Moving on to **THE LEVEL OF INNOVATION/AUTOMATION**, Iceland excels in integrating advanced automation technologies in geothermal energy plants, such as real-time monitoring systems, which enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In contrast, Vietnam is making strides in automating solar and wind energy systems, albeit at a slower pace, with pilot projects in smart grid technologies underway. Both countries recognize the importance of innovation in transitioning to sustainable energy."

### SPEAKER 2: TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**Speech:**

"Thank you. I’ll now focus on **TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES**. Iceland leads the way with cutting-edge geothermal technologies, such as deep drilling to harness high-temperature resources, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Vietnam, on the other hand, is adopting advanced solar panels with higher efficiency rates, including bifacial panels, and exploring offshore wind turbine technology to maximize its renewable potential.

When it comes to **POTENTIAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENTS**, Iceland has a strong legal framework for IP protection, with minimal reported disputes in renewable energy. Vietnam, however, faces challenges in enforcing IP rights, particularly in the solar sector, where reports of patent disputes and counterfeit equipment remain a concern. Addressing these issues will be crucial for fostering trust and innovation in Vietnam’s energy market."

### SPEAKER 3: EDUCATION, R&D, AND OUTSOURCING

**Speech:**

"Let’s shift our focus to the importance of **EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO USE INNOVATION**. Iceland places a strong emphasis on renewable energy education, offering specialized programs in geothermal energy at universities like Reykjavik University. Vietnam, while less advanced, has launched vocational training programs to build a skilled workforce for its growing solar and wind industries.

Regarding **RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) ACTIVITY AND MARKET TECHNOLOGICAL AWARENESS**, Iceland invests approximately 2.4% of its GDP in R&D, with a significant portion directed toward renewable energy innovation. Vietnam’s R&D spending is lower, at about 0.5% of GDP, but the country is collaborating with international organizations like IRENA to boost its capabilities.

Finally, **USE OF OUTSOURCING IN R&D** is notable in Vietnam, where foreign companies contribute to developing and deploying renewable technologies. In contrast, Iceland relies more on domestic expertise and government-supported research programs."

### SPEAKER 4: INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING RENEWABLE ENERGY

**Speech:**

"To conclude, I’ll address the **INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING RENEWABLE ENERGY** in Iceland and Vietnam. Starting with **INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE**, Iceland boasts nearly 100% broadband penetration and high-speed internet, which supports the digitalization of its energy systems. Vietnam, while improving, has a broadband penetration rate of 70%, which limits some advancements in renewable energy monitoring and automation.

In terms of **COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE**, Iceland benefits from robust IoT-enabled systems in its energy sector, while Vietnam is still developing such capabilities, focusing on smart grid pilot projects in urban areas.

Finally, **TRANSPORTATION** infrastructure in Iceland, with its well-maintained roads, facilitates the easy transport of renewable energy equipment. Vietnam faces challenges with logistics, particularly in remote areas where road quality hinders the deployment of wind and solar equipment. However, ongoing investments in transportation infrastructure show promise for the future."
