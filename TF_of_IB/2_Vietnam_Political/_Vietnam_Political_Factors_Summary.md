# Government foreign policy (towards certain countries)

- **China**: Complex relations; territorial disputes but some joint energy development efforts in the South China Sea.
- **Japan**: Major partner; part of $15.5B JETP investment in 2022 to shift from coal to renewables.
- **South Korea**: Growing investment; SK Group drives tech transfer and renewable project expansion.
- **United States**: Elevated partnership; $15.5B JETP support (Dec 2022) + $50M USAID investment in green energy over 5 years.


# Political stability or instability

- **Stability Score**: Vietnam scored 47.2 on the World Bank's political stability percentile in 2022, indicating moderate stability.
- **Government Commitment**: Strong support for renewables; $15.5B JETP commitment in 2022.
- **Leadership Changes**: Recent resignation of President Vo Van Thuong (2024) amid anti-corruption efforts; policies on renewables remain stable.
- **Sector Impact**: Regulatory challenges persist; Equinor paused offshore wind plans in August 2024 due to bureaucracy.


# Corruption level (index of corruption)

- **Corruption Score**: Vietnam scored 41/100 on Transparency International's CPI in 2023, ranking 83rd of 180 countries.
- **Investment Impact**: Corruption deters foreign investment due to unpredictable regulatory practices and bureaucratic inefficiencies.
- **Anti-Corruption Efforts**: The “Blazing Furnace” campaign led to high-profile resignations, aiming to improve governance but also introducing political instability.

# Interaction between politics and business

- **State Control**: Vietnam Electricity (EVN) controls the grid as the sole buyer, challenging private investors.
- **Private Sector**: Feed-in tariffs (FITs) spurred private investments but sudden policy shifts affect confidence.
- **Partnerships**: VSEA advocates for renewable targets; consulted in Power Development Plan VIII.
- **Lobbying**: EuroCham lobbies for stable, transparent regulations to boost foreign investments.

# Foreign investment climate

- **Incentives**: Corporate tax (10% for 15 years), import duty exemptions, and land use incentives boost FDI.
- **Challenges**: Regulatory complexity (e.g., shift from FITs to competitive bidding) and grid limitations affect investments.
- **Trends**: $15.5B mobilized by JETP; Germany's PNE proposed $4.6B offshore wind project.

# Government policy towards foreign businesses

- **Ownership**: 100% foreign ownership allowed; joint ventures required only for strategic projects.
- **Tax Incentives**: 10% CIT for 15 years + duty exemptions for renewable projects.
- **Regulatory Shift**: FITs replaced by competitive bidding to improve transparency.
- **Targets**: Renewable energy to reach 30% of power mix by 2030.

# Foreign trade policy (tariffs, etc.)

- **Tariffs**: Import duty exemptions available for renewable tech under Vietnam’s Law on Import and Export Taxes.
- **Free Trade Agreements**: EVFTA (EU), UKVFTA, and CPTPP reduce tariffs on renewable components, enhancing affordability.
- **Competitiveness**: Tariff reductions make Vietnam’s renewable market more accessible, boosting foreign investments.

# Trade restrictions

- **Import Duties**: Select renewable equipment qualifies for exemptions, but tariffs still apply to some, raising project costs.
- **Partnerships**: No explicit restrictions, though strategic investments may face scrutiny.
- **Cross-Border**: EVN's control and lack of regulatory framework limit cross-border energy trade.

# Free economic zones

- **Scope**: 18 coastal zones and 325 industrial parks offer tax and import incentives for investors.
- **Tax Benefits**: 10% CIT for 15 years, 4-year exemption, and 50% reduction for 9 years.
- **Investment Draw**: Attracts foreign and domestic renewable energy projects, like Dung Quat's wind and solar.

# Tax policy (resident/non-resident companies + business entities with FDI + personal incomes of foreigners)

- **Corporate Income Tax (CIT)**: Standard 20%; renewables get 10% for 15 years + 4-year exemption and 50% reduction for 9 years.

# Participation of state-owned businesses in foreign projects

- **PetroVietnam (PVN)**: Invested in international solar and wind projects to expand renewable energy portfolio.
- **EVN**: Pursues hydropower in Laos and Cambodia, boosting regional energy security.
