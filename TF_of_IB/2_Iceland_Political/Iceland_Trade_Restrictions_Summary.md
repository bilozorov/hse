# Slide: Trade Restrictions (PESTEL Analysis - Political Factors)

**Summary**: Iceland's renewable energy sector benefits from minimal trade restrictions, enabling easy access to necessary technology and resources.

- **Low Tariffs**: Minimal import tariffs on renewable tech reduce costs ([WTO Tariff Download Facility](https://tariffdata.wto.org/)).
- **FTAs**: EFTA agreements reduce tariffs on environmental goods, boosting market access ([Cross-Border Trade in Electricity](https://docslib.org/doc/5273333/cross-border-trade-in-electricity-under-eu-eea-and-wto-law-a-case-study-iceland)).
- **Isolated Grid**: EU cross-border energy policies do not apply due to Icelandâ€™s isolated electricity grid ([European Commission - Third Energy Package](https://commission.europa.eu/news/joint-understanding-application-third-energy-package-towards-iceland-2019-03-22_en)).
