## Recent Government Transitions
In October 2024, Iceland's three-party coalition government, comprising the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left Green Movement, collapsed due to disagreements on issues such as immigration, energy policy, and the economy. This led to the announcement of parliamentary elections scheduled for November 30, 2024. Despite this political shift, the renewable energy sector is expected to remain unaffected due to the broad political consensus supporting it.
