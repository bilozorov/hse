## 5. Disposable Income of Consumers

### Overview
Disposable income in Vietnam has been steadily increasing as a result of rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam, the average per capita disposable income increased from USD 3,700 in 2020 to approximately USD 4,300 in 2023. Rising incomes are contributing to increased energy consumption, as more households can afford modern appliances and higher living standards.

### Disposable Income Trends
- **Average Disposable Income**: USD 4,300 per capita in 2023 (General Statistics Office of Vietnam).
- **Growth**: Disposable income has grown by an average of 5-6% annually over the past decade.
- **Urban vs Rural**: Urban households have significantly higher disposable incomes, with many cities experiencing an income growth rate of 7-8% compared to rural areas where growth is slower.

### Impact on Renewable Energy Demand
1. **Higher Energy Consumption**: As disposable income rises, so does energy consumption. Households are increasingly investing in energy-intensive appliances such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and electric vehicles, leading to higher overall energy demand.
2. **Green Energy Solutions**: Rising disposable income also encourages consumers to adopt more environmentally friendly energy solutions, such as rooftop solar panels, which are gaining popularity in urban areas. However, the adoption of such technologies remains limited in rural regions due to lower income levels.
3. **Government Incentives**: The Vietnamese government has introduced financial incentives and subsidies to encourage the adoption of green energy solutions at the household level. Programs like rooftop solar incentives are aimed at leveraging rising disposable income to support the countryâ€™s renewable energy goals.

### Future Projections
- **Income Growth Outlook**: Disposable incomes are expected to continue growing at 5-6% annually through 2025, driven by continued economic growth and urbanization. This will likely result in increased demand for renewable energy solutions as more households can afford green technology investments.
- **Consumer Investments**: With rising incomes, consumer investment in energy-efficient appliances and solar energy systems is projected to rise, particularly in urban centers where purchasing power is strongest.
