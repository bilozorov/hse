# Economic Analysis of Vietnam's Renewable Energy Sector (SIC Code 4911 - Electric Services)
## 12. Distribution Networks

### Overview
The efficiency and scalability of renewable energy solutions in Vietnam are heavily influenced by the state of the country’s distribution networks and grid infrastructure. Vietnam’s energy grid is primarily managed by Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the state-owned utility responsible for electricity transmission and distribution. As the country rapidly increases its renewable energy capacity, challenges related to grid capacity, connectivity, and energy transmission efficiency have become central to the sector’s growth.

### Grid Infrastructure and Accessibility
- **National Grid Coverage**: Vietnam has a well-developed national grid that covers over 99% of the country’s households, including rural areas. This extensive coverage is a key enabler of renewable energy distribution across the country.
  
- **Transmission Capacity**: Despite the widespread grid coverage, the capacity of Vietnam’s transmission infrastructure is lagging behind the rapid growth in renewable energy generation. The grid has faced bottlenecks, particularly in regions with high solar and wind potential, such as Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan provinces, where existing transmission lines are insufficient to handle the influx of renewable energy generation.

- **EVN’s Role**: EVN is responsible for maintaining the grid infrastructure and ensuring stable electricity supply. It has made significant investments in expanding transmission networks, but more work is needed to accommodate the projected growth in renewable energy.

### Energy Transmission Efficiency
- **Grid Efficiency**: The efficiency of Vietnam’s grid is moderate, with transmission and distribution losses estimated at around 8-9% in 2023. This figure is slightly higher than global benchmarks of 6-7% in developed markets, highlighting the need for infrastructure upgrades to improve energy transmission efficiency.

- **Grid Modernization**: Vietnam is working on modernizing its grid through smart grid technologies and digital solutions, which are expected to reduce losses and enhance the grid’s ability to integrate a higher share of renewable energy.

### Challenges in Distribution and Scalability
1. **Grid Bottlenecks**: The rapid development of large-scale solar and wind projects has led to congestion in the grid, with many projects unable to connect to the national grid due to a lack of transmission capacity. This has delayed the scalability of renewable energy solutions and increased project costs.

2. **Investment Needs**: According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT), Vietnam requires an additional USD 5-7 billion in investment for grid expansion and upgrades by 2030 to accommodate the expected growth in renewable energy. This includes building new transmission lines, substations, and grid storage systems to support intermittent energy sources like wind and solar.

3. **Regional Disparities**: Renewable energy distribution is concentrated in a few key regions, particularly the central and southern provinces, where solar and wind resources are abundant. However, the uneven distribution of generation capacity compared to demand centers in the north poses challenges for energy transmission and balancing the load across the country.

### Future Outlook
- **Power Development Plan VIII (PDP VIII)**: The Vietnamese government’s Power Development Plan VIII aims to address these grid challenges by expanding transmission infrastructure, increasing grid capacity, and integrating more renewable energy into the grid. The plan outlines investments in high-voltage transmission lines and storage solutions to reduce bottlenecks and improve distribution efficiency.

- **Smart Grid Development**: Vietnam is also focusing on developing a smart grid system that will facilitate better integration of renewable energy and reduce transmission losses, helping to optimize energy distribution.
