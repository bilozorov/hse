| **Metric**            | **Formula**                  | **FY2023 (Pre-Acquisition)**      | **FY2024 (Post-Acquisition)**     | **Analysis**                                                                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Net Profit Margin**  | Net Income ÷ Revenue         | 28.9% (Net Income: $61,274M; Revenue: $211,915M) | 36.6% (Net Income: $72,574M; Revenue: $198,270M) | Improved from 28.9% to 36.6%, reflecting increased profitability.                           |
| **Gross Margin**       | (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue   | 69.1% (COGS: $65,423M)            | 69.8% (COGS: $59,800M)            | Slight improvement from 69.1% to 69.8%, indicating better production efficiency.            |
| **Operating Margin**   | Operating Income ÷ Revenue   | 43.2% (Operating Income: $91,564M)| 42.1% (Operating Income: $83,543M)| Declined slightly from 43.2% to 42.1%, suggesting increased operational expenses.            |
| **Return on Equity**   | Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity | 31.5% (Equity: $194,413M)       | 43.6% (Equity: $166,542M)         | Significant improvement from 31.5% to 43.6%, indicating enhanced returns for shareholders.   |

## Conclusion

Post-acquisition, Microsoft experienced improvements in **Net Profit Margin**, **Gross Margin**, and **Return on Equity (ROE)**, indicating enhanced profitability and efficient utilization of shareholders' equity. However, the slight decline in **Operating Margin** suggests that operational expenses increased relative to revenue, which may warrant further analysis.

|----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Current Ratio**    | Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities | 1.77 (Assets: $184.257B; Liabilities: $104.149B) | 1.28 (Assets: $159.734B; Liabilities: $125.286B) | Decreased from 1.77 to 1.28, indicating reduced ability to cover short-term obligations.    |
| **Quick Ratio**      | (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities | 1.74 (Inventory: $2.500B)               | 1.27 (Inventory: $1.246B)               | Declined from 1.74 to 1.27, reflecting weaker liquidity post-acquisition.                   |

## Conclusion

Post-acquisition, both the **Current Ratio** and **Quick Ratio** have declined, suggesting a weaker liquidity position. This can be attributed to the significant cash outlay for the acquisition and an increase in current liabilities. While still above 1.0, these declines may indicate tighter liquidity management post-deal.
