## Speaker 3: Accounting Hypotheses and Goodwill
- **Hypothesis 1: Goodwill Recognition**
  - “The first hypothesis we examined was whether the acquisition resulted in significant goodwill recognition.”
  - “This hypothesis is confirmed. Microsoft’s Goodwill-to-Total Assets Ratio rose from 16.4% to 25.1%.”
  - “This increase reflects the premium Microsoft paid, emphasizing the strategic value of Activision Blizzard’s intellectual properties and brand equity.”
- **Explanation of Goodwill:**
  - “Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents future economic benefits. In this case, it includes Activision Blizzard’s franchises like *Call of Duty* and *World of Warcraft*.”
  - “This goodwill will enable Microsoft to strengthen its gaming portfolio and drive subscription-based growth.”

## Speaker 4: Financial Leverage and Liquidity
- **Hypothesis 2: Financial Leverage**
  - “Next, we evaluated whether the acquisition improved Microsoft’s financial leverage.”
  - “This hypothesis is confirmed. The Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from 0.28 to 0.23, indicating reduced leverage.”
  - “Microsoft also improved its Interest Coverage Ratio from 44.25 to 52.10, demonstrating stronger capacity to meet interest payments.”
- **Liquidity Metrics:**
  - “However, the acquisition impacted liquidity metrics. The Current Ratio fell from 1.77 to 1.28, and the Quick Ratio declined from 1.74 to 1.27.”
  - “While still above 1.0, these figures reflect tighter liquidity management due to the significant cash outlay for the acquisition.”
- **Conclusion:**
  - “Overall, Microsoft’s strong balance sheet and efficient financing strategies ensured reduced leverage and manageable liquidity challenges.”

## Speaker 5: Asset Utilization Efficiency and Conclusion
- **Hypothesis 3: Asset Utilization Efficiency**
  - “Our third hypothesis tested whether the acquisition enhanced Microsoft’s asset utilization efficiency.”
  - “This hypothesis was disproved. The Asset Turnover Ratio declined slightly from 0.51 to 0.48.”
  - “This indicates that Activision Blizzard’s assets have not yet been fully optimized to generate revenue.”
- **Reasons for Decline:**
  - “The decline is likely due to integration lag, as it takes time for acquired assets to align with Microsoft’s operations.”
  - “Additionally, the increase in intangible assets, like goodwill, inflates total assets without immediate revenue impact.”
- **Summary and Final Thoughts:**
  - “In conclusion, the acquisition confirmed significant goodwill recognition and improved financial leverage, but challenges remain in liquidity management and asset efficiency.”
  - “As integration progresses, Microsoft is well-positioned to realize long-term strategic benefits from this acquisition.”
