# Accounting Hypotheses for Analysis

## **Key Hypotheses**
- **Hypothesis 1:**  
  The acquisition resulted in significant goodwill recognition on Microsoft’s balance sheet.  
  *Rationale:* The $68.7 billion valuation likely includes a premium over Activision Blizzard's net assets.  

- **Hypothesis 2:**  
  The deal led to substantial amortization of intangible assets, impacting net income.  
  *Rationale:* Activision Blizzard's intellectual property (e.g., game franchises) is a core driver of valuation. Amortization could create non-cash expenses affecting profitability.  

- **Hypothesis 3:**  
  The acquisition improved Microsoft’s gaming segment revenue and profitability.  
  *Rationale:* Activision Blizzard’s portfolio complements Microsoft’s gaming ecosystem, including Xbox and Game Pass.
